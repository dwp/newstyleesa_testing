    <p class="govuk-body-l">There may be a delay in processing your application because of the coronavirus outbreak. We aim to get back to you by <span class="new-date"></span>.</p>
    <p>Please do not contact the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for an update before then.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Send us medical evidence to support your application</h3>

    <p>You can self-certify for the first 7 days of your claim but you need to send us medical evidence from day 8 onwards.</p>
    <p>The most common type of medical certificate is a fit note (also called a statement of fitness for work or a sick note), but we also accept other types of medical evidence.</p>

      <div class="govuk-details__text">
        <p id="other-medical-evidence-hint">As well as fit notes, we also accept these medical certificates:
          
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Med10 (a hospital certificate given to inpatients if your treatment lasts more than 7 days)</li>
      <li>MATB1 (if you’re pregnant but you cannot get Statutory Maternity Pay or Maternity Allowance)</li>
      <li>CF73 (a form issued by a psychiatric hospital)</li>
      <li>DS1500 (a form completed and sent to us by a doctor, consultant or specialist nurse if they think you might not live longer than 6 months, because of your condition)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other forms of evidence might include a doctor’s statement, consultant’s report or Local Authority notice.</p>
  
  </div>
  </details>

  <p>You will need to keep sending us medical evidence as long as you’re unfit for work. We will tell you when you can stop sending it. For example, if your fit note is for 14 days, you will need to send us another one when it runs out.</p>

  <div class="govuk-inset-text">
    <p>You do not need to send medical evidence if you’re claiming New Style ESA because of coronavirus. We will contact you in 14 days about your claim.</p>
